Traditional methods struggle to secure CAN networks in vehicles. This research explores Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for improved intrusion detection. GNNs leverage the structure of CAN messages and message features, offering richer data analysis. Experiments showed promise for GNNs, especially with effective data preprocessing. However, learnable embeddings within the GNN model were crucial for performance, suggesting vendor-specific data encoding might be a hurdle. Overall, this research highlights the potential of GNNs for network security, paving the way for further exploration.
